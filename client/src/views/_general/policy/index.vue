              information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website
              ("Log Data"). This Log Data may include information such as your

              visiting, the web-pages you visit, the search terms you use, and

              the Internet from an Internet service provider the IP address will
              be different every time you log on. We use Log Data to monitor the
              use of the Site and of our Service, and for the Site’s technical
              administration. We do not associate your IP address with any other

            <dt>7. Cookies and Similar Technologies</dt>
            <dd>
              Like many websites, we also use "cookie" technology to collect
              additional website usage data and to improve the Site and our
              service. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your
              computer’s hard disk. We do not use cookies to collect personally
              identifiable information. Hoot.vn may use both session cookies and
              persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with the
              Site and our Service, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and
              web traffic routing on the Site, and to improve the Site and our
              services.
            </dd>
            <dd>
              A session cookie enables certain features of the Site and our
              service and is deleted from your computer when you disconnect from
              or leave the Site. A persistent cookie remains after you close
              your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits
              to the Site. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your
              web browser help file directions. Most Internet browsers
              automatically accept cookies. You can instruct your browser, by
              editing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you
              before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. Please note
              that if you delete, or choose not to accept, cookies from the
              Service, you may not be able to utilize the features of the
              Service to their fullest potential. Hoot.vn does not process or
              respond to web browsers’ “do not track” signals or other similar
              transmissions that indicate a request to disable online tracking
              of users who use our Service.
            </dd>
            <dd>
              We may also automatically record certain information from your
              device by using various types of technology, including “clear
              gifs” or “web beacons.” This automatically collected information
              may include your IP address or other device address or ID, web
              browser and/or device type, the web pages or sites that you visit
              just before or just after you use the Service, the pages or other
              content you view or otherwise interact with on the Service, and
              the dates and times that you visit, access, or use the Service. We
              also may use these technologies to collect information regarding
              your interaction with email messages, such as whether you opened,
              clicked on, or forwarded a message. This information is gathered
              from all users, and may be connected with other information about
              you.

              beacons, or other mechanisms for obtaining data in connection with
              your viewing of the third party content on the Service.
              Additionally, we may implement third party buttons (such as the
              Facebook “share” button) that may function as web beacons even
              when you do not interact with the button. Information collected
              through third-party web beacons and buttons is collected directly
              by these third parties, not by Hoot.vn. Information collected by a
              third party in this manner is subject to that third party’s own
              data collection, use, and disclosure policies.

              Hoot.vn is based in the Vietnam. Personal Information that
              we collect may be transferred to, and stored at, any of our
              affiliates, partners or service providers which may be inside or
              outside of Vietnam. By submitting your personal data, you
              agree to such transfers. Your Personal Information may be
              transferred to countries that do not have the same data protection
              laws as the country in which you initially provided the
              information. When we transfer or disclose your Personal
              Information to other countries, we will protect that information
              as described in this Privacy Policy.

            <dt>13. Our Policy Towards Children</dt>
            <dd>
              The Site is not directed to persons under 16. If a parent or
              guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with
              personally identifiable information without their consent, he or
              she should contact us at support@hoot.vn. We do not knowingly
              collect personally identifiable information from children under
              16. If we become aware that a child under 16 has provided us with
              personal identifiable Information, we will delete such information
              from our files.
            </dd>
            <dt>14. Your rights</dt>
            <dd>
              You can contact us to obtain a copy of the Personal Information
              held about you by us. This may be subject to a fee not exceeding
              any prescribed fee permitted by applicable law, if any. You can
              also ask us to correct and, where relevant, erase that
              information. As mentioned above you have a right to change your
              email preferences at any time.
            </dd>
            <dd>
              If you are a registered user of the Site, you may access and
              update or correct the information you provided to us by e-mailing us at
              cskh@hoot.vn. Please note that while any changes you make will
              be reflected in active user databases within a reasonable period
              of time, we may retain all information you submit for backups,
              archiving, prevention of fraud and abuse, analytics, satisfaction
              of legal obligations, or where we otherwise reasonably believe
              that we have a legitimate reason to do so. To avoid any
              misunderstanding, in the event the user requests that all Personal
              Information be deleted, then Hoot.vn shall proceed in accordance
              with such request in reasonable time. Please be aware that once
              you have deleted your account or any Personal Information within
              your account, Hoot.vn will no longer hold that Personal
              Information and will thus be unable to restore it.
            </dd>
            <dd>
              You should be aware that Hoot.vn acts as a conduit between our
              users and the various Supported Platforms and Third-Party Apps. In
              several instances, the content published via Hoot.vn will not be
              in Hoot.vn’s custody or control, and any content that has been
              shared by you through any Supported Platform or Third-Party Apps
              via the Services may continue to be available to third parties and
              the public at large, as this content is now under the control of
              the operators of the Supported Platforms and/or the Third-Party
              Apps.

              Where required by law, we obtain your consent for the processing
              of certain Personal Information collected by cookies or similar
              technologies, or used to send you direct marketing communications,
              or when we carry out other processing activities for which consent
              may be required. If we rely on consent for the processing of your
              Personal Information, you have the right to withdraw it at any
              time and free of charge. When you do so, this will not affect the
              lawfulness of the processing before your consent withdrawal.
